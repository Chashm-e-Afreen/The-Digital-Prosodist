1. Adding the functionality for alif-e-wasl.
2. Dealing with homophones i.e. words with the same spelling but different weights. 
3. The conditions with ? and ? don't seem to be working, must look for a fix.
4. For words such as زمانے and دیے, the program should should be able to replace the ے with a ا and a ہ 
and then search the word in the dictionary.
5. The program should be able to deal with words that end with وں and یں endings e.g. کتابوں، غزلوں ، نظمیں
etc. 
If ends with یں or وں
	weight.back() = 1
	weight2 = weight + "0";
else ends with یں or وں and preceeding letter is ا or و
	weight = weight + "1";
	weight2 = weight + "10"
6. The program currently doesn't work for words that can have more than two weights.
