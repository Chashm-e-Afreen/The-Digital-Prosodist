1. For words such as زمانے and دیے, the program should should be able to replace the ے with a ا and a ہ 
and then search the word in the dictionary.
2. The program should be able to deal with words that end with وں and یں endings e.g. کتابوں، غزلوں ، نظمیں
etc. 
If ends with یں or وں
	weight.back() = 1
	weight2 = weight + "0";
else ends with یں or وں and preceeding letter is ا or و
	weight = weight + "1";
	weight2 = weight + "10"
3. Dealing with words like تصویرو by removing the vao and searching and eventually adding a 0 to the weight of the fetched word. 
    If the original isn't found of course.
