Rules:

1. A binary encoding is to be used for the weights.
2. Each mutaharrik harf should be represented by 1 and each sakin with 0.
3. Every harf with no harakat or jazm on it is sakin(0) until and unless it is followed by alif, ye or vow in which case it would be mutaharrik(1).
4. The first letter of every word is mutaharrik.
5. The last letter of every word is sakin except if it is part of a murakkab-e-tauseefi or if it is preceeded by a sakin letter. In both the cases it would act as a mutaharrik(1) letter.
6. A shad is actually a sakin letter followed by the same letter but now with a harakat on it so it should have a 01 weight.
7. A khari-zabar should be considered as a sakin harf that comes after the letter it is on however, if it comes at the end of a word it should be ignored e.g. عقبیٰ and عقبی have the same weights. 
8. If ے or ہ occur at the end of the word the letter preceeding them will always be mutaharrik provided that it isn't ا ، ی or و.
