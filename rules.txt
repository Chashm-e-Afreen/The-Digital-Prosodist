- A binary encoding is to be used for the weights.
- Each mutaharrik harf should be represented by 1 and each sakin with 0.
- Every harf with no harakat or jazm on it is sakin(0) until and unless it is followed by alif, ye or vow in which case it would be mutaharrik(1).
- The first letter of every word is mutaharrik.
- The last letter of every word is mutaharrik except if it is part of a murakkab-e-tauseefi or if it is preceeded by a sakin letter. In both the cases it would act as a mutaharrik(1) letter.
- A shad is actually a sakin letter followed by the same letter but now with a harakat on it so it should have a 01 weight.
- A khari-zabar should be considered as a sakin harf that comes after the letter it is on however, if it comes at the end of a word it should be ignored e.g. عقبیٰ and عقبی have the same weights. 
- If ے or ہ are occur at the end of the word the letter preceeding them will always be mutaharrik provided that it isn't ا ، ی or و.
