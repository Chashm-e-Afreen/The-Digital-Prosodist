For the metre matching part here's a rough sketch:

1. If no match is found in any of the verses entered then we'd want to first put all of our meter sequences(keys) in a vector, sort it and then use std::search(Boyes-Moore) for a partial match. 
This of course has a very low priority since no match found is already quite decent.

2. If there is only one match found then all the entered verses should be compared against it. Shouldn't be very difficult to imlement. We'll push the meter into a vector and then compare all 
combinations against it, std::mismatch/std::search may be used for the comparison. 

3. In case of multiple matches the one that occurs the most should be the one to which everything gets compared.
